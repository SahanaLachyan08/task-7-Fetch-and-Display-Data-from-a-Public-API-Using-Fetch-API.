# User Directory (Fetch API Project)

A simple, clean web application that fetches user data from the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) public API and displays it as a set of responsive, dark-mode cards.


## Features

* **Fetches Live Data:** Asynchronously fetches user data from a public API.
* **Dynamic Card Layout:** Displays each user in their own card, including name, email, company, and address.
* **Responsive Design:** The grid layout adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
* **Dark Mode Theme:** A sleek, modern dark theme is easy on the eyes.
* **Reload Button:** A "Reload Data" button allows the user to re-fetch the data from the API at any time.
* **Error Handling:** Displays a user-friendly error message if the API call fails.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the page.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including the dark mode theme and responsive grid layout (using Flexbox/Grid).
* **JavaScript (ES6+):**
    * **Fetch API:** To make asynchronous network requests.
    * **Async/Await:** For cleaner handling of promises.
    * **DOM Manipulation:** To dynamically create and display the user cards.
